This proof-of-concept is the product of a thought experiment on how we decide between alternatives when making decisions. The tool enables the creation of a "decision matrix," while supporting basic prioritization and qualifiers for uncertainty. The design was inspired by tools such as the Pugh Decision Matrix. 
    
This tool was built using HTML, Javascript, and jQuery. The code is riddled with poor logic and inefficiencies, but it mostly works.
